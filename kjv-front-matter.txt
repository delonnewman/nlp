The King James Bible


Notes from the previous editions:

This is a modified version of: The Project Gutenberg Edition of the
King James Bible.

The only changes made were the addition of the book numbers to the
verse numbers to make it easier to find desired passages of text in
this work and the addition of a Table Of Contents.

**** This version of the King James Bible was created by taking several
public domain copies and painstakingly comparing them to find all the
differences, and selecting the most common version. Each of the
differences was also compared to printed versions for verification.
